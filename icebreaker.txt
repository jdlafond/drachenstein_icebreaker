The flughafen in Berlin was extremely busy. The klimaanlage was not working and the heat was so intense I was burning up like a bratwurst. My friend picked me up in a BMW. Suddenly a Porsche pull alongside us and began blasting Rammstein! I'm enjoying the hund lunging in the backseat. The baeckerei in my neighborhood sells the best brot. I was enjoying my time at the beach when suddenly a hund snatched my apfelkuchen from my hand and ate it.
