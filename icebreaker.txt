The flughafen in Berlin was extremely busy. The klimaanlage was not working and the heat was so intense I was burning up like a bratwurst. My friend picked me up in a BMW. Suddenly a Porsche pull alongside us and began blasting Rammstein! I'm enjoying the hund lunging in the backseat. Distracted from admiration, suddenly the hund snatched the apfelkuchen from my hand and ate it. Defeated, I found myself seeking the local ratskeller to relieve my woes. Everyone in the ratskeller on the hauptstrasse turned to look at me as I walked in because of my fabulous lederhosen.
